# Introduction To Programming

This is the repo with my solutions (@github/toduko) of some of the problems given in the **IP 2021/2022** course (**Sofia University FMI**). I try to solve most of the problems even if they repeat. Issues are welcome.

## Disclaimers

- Solutions may use syntax that wasn't covered at the time of the task being given (e.g. functions are always used even before they were covered)
- Everything in the repo can change or get deleted.
